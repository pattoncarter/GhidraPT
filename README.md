# GhidraPT
This is a Ghidra plugin written in Python that takes decompiled functions and summarizes their purpose via ChatGPT's API.

We will be striving to simplify the process of reverse engineering code by bringing ChatGPT's ability to effectively summarize code right to Ghidra via plugin!

We will be using OpenAI's GPT API, the same API used in the ever-popular ChatGPT aplication.
